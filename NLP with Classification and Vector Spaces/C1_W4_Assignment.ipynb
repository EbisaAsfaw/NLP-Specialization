Especially in NLP, you can often continue training for months and the model will continue getting slightly and slightly better. This is also the reason why it's hard to just stop at a threshold -- unless there's an external customer setting the threshold, why stop, where do you put the threshold?\n",

You can then try to get the best performance within this time budget. Another advantage is that you can fix your learning rate schedule -- e.g., lower the learning rate at 10% before finish, and then again more at 1% before finishing. Such learning rate schedules help a lot, but are harder to do if you don't know how long you're training.\n",
